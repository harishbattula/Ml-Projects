# Movie Recommendation System
These systems estimate the most likely product that consumers will buy and that they will be interested in. Netflix, Amazon, and other companies use recommender systems to help their users find the right product or movie for them.
Recommendations are done by a system called a recommendation system. This engine makes suggestions by learning and understanding the patterns in user watch history (let’s say) and then applies those patterns and findings to make new suggestions.

In this repository, we build a recommendation system from the ground up to suggest movies to the user based on user preferences.
There are 3 types of recommendation systems.
### Demographic Filtering
The recommendations are the same for every user. They are generalized, not personalized. These types of systems are behind sections like “Top Trending”.
### Content-based Filtering
These suggest recommendations based on the item metadata (movie, product, song, etc). Here, the main idea is if a user likes an item, then the user will also like items similar to it.
### Collaboration-based Filtering
These systems make recommendations by grouping the users with similar interests. For this system, metadata of the item is not required. It is based on matrix factorzation technique
