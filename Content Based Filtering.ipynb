    "## Content Based Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "![alt text](GoogleRecommendationForTheDarkKnight.png \"Google Movie Recommendation\")\n",
    "Google comes up with movies that are similar to the ones you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there are (mostly) three ways to build a recommendation engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Popularity based recommendation engine\n",
    "    2. Content based recommendation engine\n",
    "    3. Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine\n",
    "    \n",
    "<h5>Popularity based recommendation engine:</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps, this is the simplest kind of recommendation engine that every one can implement. The trending list we see in YouTube or Netflix is based on this algorithm. It keeps a track of view counts for each movie/video and then lists movies based on views in descending order(highest view count to lowest view count). It is Pretty simple but, effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Content based recommendation engine:</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of recommendation systems, takes in a movie that a user currently likes as input. Then it analyzes the contents (storyline, genre, cast, director etc.) of the movie to find out other movies which have similar content. Then it ranks similar movies according to their similarity scores and recommends the most relevant movies to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine: </h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm at first tries to find similar users based on their activities and preferences (for example, both the users watch same type of movies or movies directed by the same director). Now, between these users(say, A and B) if user A has seen a movie that user B has not seen yet, then that movie gets recommended to user B and vice-versa. In other words, the recommendations get filtered based on the collaboration between similar user’s preferences (thus, the name “Collaborative Filtering”). One typical application of this algorithm can be seen in the Amazon e-commerce platform, where you get to see the “Customers who viewed this item also viewed” and “Customers who bought this item also bought” list.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](AmazonRecommendation.jpg \"Amazon Recommendation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](ContentvsCollaborative.png \"Content vs collaborative\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of recommendation system can be created by mixing properties of two or more types of recommendation systems. This type of recommendation systems are known as hybrid recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are implementing content based recommendation system using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Finding the similarity\n",
    "We know our recommendation system is content based, so we need to find simliar movies for a given movie and then recommend those movies to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how can we find which movie is similar to given movie, and how much it is similar to given movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "For suppose let's say we have two sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Bangalore Hyderabad Bangalore\"\n",
    "2. \"Hyderabad Hyderabad Bangalore\"\n",
    "\n",
    "we can write above strings as a vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Bangalore Hyderabad\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (2, 1)\n",
    "2. (1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing those two vectors in graph will be like this\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](graph.png \"Graph\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the blue vector represents “Sentence 1” and the red vector represents “Sentence 1”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have graphically represented these two sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two texts are represented as vectors. Right? So, we can say that two vectors are similar if the distance between them is small. By distance, we mean the angular distance between two vectors, which is represented by θ (theta). By thinking further from the machine learning perspective, we can understand that the value of cos θ makes more sense to us rather than the value of θ (theta) because, the cosine(or “cos”) function will map the value of θ in the first quadrant between 0 to 1 (Remember? cos 90° = 0 and cos 0° = 1 ).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cosine similarity\n",
    "It is a metric, helpful in determining, how similar the data objects are irrespective of their size. We can measure the similarity between two sentences in Python using Cosine Similarity. In cosine similarity, data objects in a dataset are treated as a vector. \n",
    "The formula to find the cosine similarity between two vectors is given by--\n",
    "\n",
    "Cos(x, y) = x . y / ||x|| * ||y||\n",
    "\n",
    "where,\n",
    "\n",
    "x . y = product (dot) of the vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.\n",
    "\n",
    "||x|| and ||y|| = length of the two vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.\n",
    "\n",
    "||x|| * ||y|| = cross product of the two vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example to find the similarity between two vectors – ‘x’ and ‘y’, using Cosine Similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘x’ vector has values, x = { 1, 6, 3, 0 }\n",
    "The ‘y’ vector has values, y = { 1, 7, 4, 1 }\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the cosine similarity is : Cos(x, y) = x . y / ||x|| * ||y||"
